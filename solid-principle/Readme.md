## What is SOLID?
It refers to the five design principles to make software easier to understand, maintain, and scale. Usually used in OOP.

---
1. Single Responsibility Principle (S)
```
A class should only responsible to do one thing. Or only have one reason to change
```
2. Open Close Principle (O)
```
Class should open for extension but closed for modification
```
3. Liskov substitution Principle (L)
```
Subclasses should be replaceable for their base classes without breaking functionality.
```
4. Interface Segregation Principle
```
Clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use.
```
5. Dependency Inversion Principle
```
Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
